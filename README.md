```bash
bashgpt - Bash shell auto-completion via OpenAI's GPT API

Usage:
  ? <PROMPT>
  bashgpt <COMMAND>

Available Commands:
  config                         Initial setup of bashgpt (set API key)
  help                           This help screen
  upgrade                        Upgrade to the latest version of bashgpt
  sh <PROMPT> [-- <RESPONSE>]    Generate a bash script from PROMPT. '? <PROMPT>'
                                 is a shortcut for 'bashgpt sh <PROMPT>'
  version                        Print the current version of bashgpt and exit

PROMPT:
  The goal you are trying to accomplish via the shell

RESPONSE:
  The previously generated response from a PROMPT. When present, bashgpt will ignore the PROMPT
  and instead just execute RESPONSE. This is done in order to work within the limitations of
  bash programmable completion.

EXAMPLES:

  bash$ ? rotate foo.png 90 degrees, convert to greyscale, and reencode as jpeg 
  convert -rotate 90 -type grayscale foo.png foo.jpg

  bash$ ? extract a 34s audio clip from bar.mpeg at offset 1m43s and encode in FLAC
  ffmpeg -ss 00:01:43 -i bar.mpeg -t 00:00:34 -c:a flac output.flac

  bash$ ? find all files under /usr larger than 128KiB, were last modified between aug 2022 and mar 2023, and are not owned by root
  find /usr -type f -size +128k ! -user root -newermt "Aug 1, 2022" ! -newermt "Mar 31, 2023"
